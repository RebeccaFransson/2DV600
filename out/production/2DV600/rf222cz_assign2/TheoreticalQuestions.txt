1. What is the Java Virtual Machine? What is Bytecode?
Java Virtual Machine: Is a simulated compuser that suns within the system. JVM runs programs written in Java.
Bytecode: Bydecodes are numeric codes, constants and references that is compacted. It's therefore it results in much better performance than direct source code when running a program.

2. What is the Java Classpath?
Classpath is a parameter that specifies the location of user-defined classes/packages. The parameter is used when running the java-program.

3. How do you compile and run your java program without the help of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., an IDE like Eclipse)?
In the command prompt. Just write "java" and your class.

4. What is a JAR file?
JAR is a package file format. Stands for "Java Archive". Its used for aggregate many java class files into one file.

5. How do you declare the starting point of a Java application?
By creating a main(String[] args) method.

6. What is a package? Why is important to declare classes inside packages?
A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
Important to declare classes because it organizes the classes in namespaces and if a class has no modifier its visible only within its own package.

7. What is an interface? Why is it important to not change them?
In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies. With a interface a class becomes more formal about the behavior it promises to provide.
If you decide to change a interface you will need to change all the children-classes too.

8. Which visibility levels are available in Java? What is the default visibility for classes, methods, and fields?
Public, protected, no modifier and private.
Default for classes, methods and fields is no modifier, also called package private(only visible for classes in the same package)

9. In the context of Java, what is an Exception? And what is an Error?
Exception is a class. This class is a Checked exception, that means it needs to be declared in a method constructors throw clause if thery can be thrown by the execution of the method/constructor.
Error is a subclass of throwable that indicated serious problems that a application should not try to catch.

10.What happened if your program terminates with an OutOfMemoryError, or NoClassDefFoundError NullPointerException?
OutOfMemoryError is thrown when Java virtual machine is out of memory and it can not take any from the garbage collector.
NoClassDefFoundError occurs if ClassLoader is not able to find the class while loading it.
NullPointerException is thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required.

11.How do you handle Exceptions in your program?
A method catches an exception using a combination of the try and catch keywords.
A try/catch block is placed around the code that might generate an exception.

12.Why is it important to test your code/application/product, before you deliver it to your customer/boss/teacher?
To make sure the application doesn't have any bugs and is stable, and that all functionality is in the application.

13.What is JavaDoc? How do you write documentation with it?
JavaDoc is a tool that in an standard way created documentation for a java-project. It generates HTML from the comments in the code.
